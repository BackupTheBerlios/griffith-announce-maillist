<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Some months after 0.6.2 release, we are proud to release Griffith 0.9
to the community. We have released a couple of Release Candidates
before. And we have tried hard to fix all the issues reported by users
meanwhile. We hope you have fun with this version as much we had
during the development phase. You will find lots of new features and
tons of fixes since the latest stable release.

These are the main changes since latest 0.9 RC3:

* Possible memory leak fixed (year data from some movie plugins wasn't parsed
  correctly)
* AnimeDB, Filmweb, PTGate and WP movie plugins updated
* CSV import plugin updated
* Fetch from Amazon function recognizes more posters now
* First movie is selected by default now
* Czech translation updated

For a complete changelog since Griffith 0.6.2, please report to the
changelog file included on the source tarball.

You can get Griffith source tarball, debian, ubuntu and windows
packages at <A HREF="http://griffith.vasconunes.net/pages/download.php">http://griffith.vasconunes.net/pages/download.php</A>

Have fun!

The Griffith development team

</PRE>
